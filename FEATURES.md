# Agent Process Features

This document tracks the implementation status of features outlined in `main.sh`.

## ✅ Implemented Features

### Docker Container Setup
- **Docker container creation** - `scripts/container.sh` builds and runs Claude Code containers
- **Hook tools integration** - Hooks are copied into the container during build
- **Workspace mounting** - Git project root is mounted as `/workspace`
- **Development environment** - Node.js 20, git, zsh, and common development tools included

### Git Integration
- **Git project validation** - Script validates current directory is a git repository
- **Git root detection** - Automatically sets workspace to git project root

### Hook System
- **Pre-bash hooks** - `hooks/pre-bash` validates bash commands before execution
- **Pre-writes hooks** - `hooks/pre-writes` validates file operations before execution  
- **Post-writes hooks** - `hooks/post-writes` performs actions after file operations
- **Post-stop hooks** - `hooks/post-stop` performs cleanup when Claude Code stops

### Container Configuration
- **Persistent volumes** - Bash history and Claude configuration are persisted
- **User permissions** - Container runs as non-root `node` user
- **Timezone setup** - Container uses Europe/Amsterdam timezone

### Network & Proxy
- **HTTP proxy setup** - Tinyproxy container provides HTTP proxy with CONNECT support
- **Domain whitelist** - Network filtering implemented for allowed domains
- **Network isolation** - Agent container restricted to internal network, proxy has dual access
- **Certificate management** - Self-signed certificates embedded in containers during build

### Git Worktree Management
- **Git worktree setup** - `scripts/worktree.sh` creates and manages git worktrees for parallel sessions
- **Worktree mounting** - Containers automatically mount worktree directories as `/workspace`
- **Agent workflow orchestration** - `scripts/agent.sh` coordinates worktree creation and container startup
- **Named container instances** - Each worktree gets its own named container for isolation

## ❌ Not Implemented Features

### Project Setup
- **CLAUDE.md creation** - No automatic CLAUDE.md file generation with gitignore
- **Goal input from user** - No interactive goal collection

### Validation & Quality Controls
- **Dependency whitelist validation** - No pre-tool dependency checking
- **Technology whitelist validation** - No pre-tool technology stack validation

### Claude Code Integration
- **Background Claude Code execution** - No automatic Claude Code startup
- **Asynchronous user interaction** - No mechanism for Claude to ask questions
- **Goal-driven execution** - No goal-based Claude Code automation

### Quality Metrics (None Implemented)
- Vulnerabilities tracking
- Application performance monitoring
- Build time tracking
- Code quality analysis
- Code change size tracking
- Dependencies monitoring
- Resource usage tracking
- Test findings tracking
- Application startup time
- Secret detection
- Code coverage tracking
- Mutation coverage
- Deployment speed tracking
- API changes tracking
- Documentation tracking
- Feature flagging
- Network interactions monitoring

## Implementation Priority

### High Priority (Core Functionality)
1. Interactive goal selection
2. CLAUDE.md automatic generation
3. Background Claude Code execution with goal

### Medium Priority (Enhanced Security)
1. Dependency and technology validation
2. Basic quality metrics (vulnerabilities, secrets)
