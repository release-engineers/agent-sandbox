# Logging Improvements for Agent Sandbox (AGS)

## Overview

The logging system has been significantly enhanced with the Python Rich library to provide a more beautiful, consistent, and informative output.

## Key Improvements

### 1. **Rich Terminal Output**
- Added `rich==13.7.1` to requirements.txt
- All print statements replaced with Rich console methods
- Color-coded output for better readability
- Emoji icons for visual clarity

### 2. **Formatted Log Lines**
The `_format_log_line` method in `agent.py` now provides:
- **Timestamp formatting**: Shows only time (HH:MM:SS) instead of full datetime
- **Tool-specific icons**: Each tool has its own emoji icon
- **Color coding**: Different tools use different colors for easy identification
- **Cleaner output**: Removes redundant prefixes and formats details nicely

### 3. **Tool Icons and Colors**
| Tool | Icon | Color |
|------|------|-------|
| Task | 🎯 | magenta |
| Read | 📖 | blue |
| Write/Edit | 📝/✏️ | green |
| Bash | 💻 | yellow |
| Grep/Glob | 🔍 | cyan |
| LS | 📁 | blue |
| TodoWrite | 📋 | purple |
| WebSearch/Fetch | 🌐 | red |

### 4. **Progress Indicators**
- Docker image building now shows a progress bar
- Status spinners for long-running operations
- Clear success/failure indicators with ✓ and ✗

### 5. **Enhanced Hook Logging**
The `pre-any` hook has been updated to:
- Remove `/workspace/` prefix from paths for cleaner display
- Better formatting for different tool types
- More descriptive action words (e.g., "Reading:", "Editing:", "Searching for:")

## Example Output

### Before:
```
[LOG] [LOG] [2025-07-18 08:30:37.141] PreToolUse: Task - Task: Explore metrics code
[LOG] [LOG] [2025-07-18 08:30:42.974] PreToolUse: Grep - Pattern: metric|metrics|lead.?time|daily|weekly|monthly|agg... in .
```

### After:
```
08:30:37 🎯 Task Explore metrics code
08:30:42 🔍 Grep Searching for: 'metric|metrics|lead' in .
```

## Installation

To use the new logging system:
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run AGS commands as usual: `ags start <name> "<goal>"`

## Benefits

1. **Improved Readability**: Color coding and icons make logs easier to scan
2. **Consistency**: All messages follow the same formatting patterns
3. **Professional Appearance**: Rich formatting provides a polished user experience
4. **Better Debugging**: Clearer log output helps identify issues faster
